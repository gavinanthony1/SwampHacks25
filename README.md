# SwampHacks Project: Retro Games Collage

Welcome to my 24-hour SwampHacks Project! This was a solo endeavor with limited time and resources, but I'm thrilled with the results. In this project, I aimed to explore the **Social Good and Human Experience** track, focusing on enhancing human experiences through a nostalgic collection of retro games. My goal was to offer a relaxing, fun, and simple escape from the fast-paced modern world, while celebrating games that have brought people together for decades.
